# Dynamic_pathfinding
This repository contains a robotics project that implements path planning using the RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm and integrates it with ROS (Robot Operating System) using the Turtlesim simulator. The goal of this project is to demonstrate efficient path planning and control of a simulated robot in a constrained environment.
